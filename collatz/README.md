# Collatz Conjecture

Calculate the amount of steps required to reach 1 according to Collatz conjecture.

>**Collatz conjecture**: Start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
>if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd,
>the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n,
>the sequence will always reach 1.
